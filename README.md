For this project, I practiced building a comprehensive data pipeline with Apache Airflow. The process initiated with web scraping IMDb for Indonesian movie data in 2023 using Selenium. 

Subsequently, I orchestrated the extraction of this data to Snowflake, where SQL programming was employed for data transformation, refining certain data types to facilitate subsequent analysis.

The ensuing phase involved a meticulous data quality check using the Soda library. Finally, the data was loaded, leading to the creation of two distinctive tables, â€˜Top 10 Movies' and 'Top 10 Longest Movies.'
